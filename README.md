Ivy is a multi-user platform that allows users to keep track of the jobs they've applied to in an easily readable format. Users can sign up, log in, edit their profile, and on the homepage they can add job applications, which will have a status label, date of application, and link to each company.
Each company has a page that users can leave comments on giving their experience about the interview process/working there.


I'm going to try to build a function to automatically scan your email to check the status of jobs, and maybe even add new jobs you've applied to. This will work by checking for emails that say "thank you for applying to xxx" or emails with the keyword hackerrank or something like that.

Initial CSS of the homepage:

I've automated the process of adding companies to the database. There are now around 1400 companies stored in the database.
I've also updated the home page CSS
